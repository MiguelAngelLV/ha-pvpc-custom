# Spain electricity hourly pricing

Custom integration _mirroring_ [official HA-Core integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/pvpc_hourly_pricing),
to be able to apply changes **quicker** than the normal release flow for HA Core.

## Installation

### HACS _(preferred method)_

**Add the integration in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)** and start using it without any HA restart :)

### Manual install

Place the `custom_components` folder in your configuration directory
(or add its contents to an existing `custom_components` folder).
